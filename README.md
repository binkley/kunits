This project covers historical, fantasy, or whimsical units:
Metric units are uninteresting except that being based on base 10, they are
not representable by binary computers (the French revolutionaries [overlooked
that](https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20180923-how-france-created-the-metric-system)).
**And this project is fun.**

USD is provided as a practical example.
English units are a good example of conversions and rational fractions.
This library shows that typing and generics improve the experience for others
in any domain&mdash;focusing on units of measure&mdash;but the lesson is
general when providing code for others.
See
[`Main.kt`](https://github.com/binkley/kunits/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/hm/binkley/kunits/Main.kt)
for examples that caller does not code for generics.

The "cow mug" for the project does not represent anything unless you're
Scottish which I am not.
Still ... "ku-nits" is a bit like "coo-nits": _fleas on cows_[^1][^2].
Working with less common units is like fleas on cows: managed and to avoid
unless necessary.
It is not so cavalier when uncommon units of measure are central.
Hopefully this project demonstrates a sensible, idiomatic means for unit
conversions, and helps you manage irritations, and learn more about Kotlin
generics. üêÆ

### Kotlin rational

Kunits depends on an older version of [`kotlin-rational`](https://github.com/binkley/kotlin-rational) to represent
"big" rationals (infinite precision fractions limited only by your computing
environment).
All example unit conversions in this project are "small" precision (ratios).
Conversions among units relies on rational (finite) ratios.

Presently there is no published dependency for `kotlin-rational` (a project of
this author).
To build KUnits, install locally from the
[`kotlin-rational-2.2.0`](https://github.com/binkley/kotlin-rational/tree/kotlin-rational-2.2.0)
tag.

### Platform

This code targets JDK 21.

## Design

<!---
TODO: Unclear it is a good idea to use line numbers in links: means keeping
this file and code source in sync more than already the case.
-->

### DSL

#### Creating measures of units

- From `Int`s:
  [`120.lines`](src/main/kotlin/hm/binkley/kunits/Main.kt#L96)
- From `Long`s:
  [`300L.drams`](src/main/kotlin/hm/binkley/kunits/Main.kt#L178)
- From `FixedBigRational`s:
  [`(12_345 over 4).seconds`](src/main/kotlin/hm/binkley/kunits/Main.kt#L154)

There are also aliases for some units such as
[`1.twopence`](src/main/kotlin/hm/binkley/kunits/Main.kt#L133) is identical to `1.tuppence`.

#### Arithmetic

- Idempotency:
  [`+m1`](src/main/kotlin/hm/binkley/kunits/Main.kt#L97)
- Negation:
  [`-m1`](src/main/kotlin/hm/binkley/kunits/Main.kt#L98)
- Addition:
  [`4.dollars + 33.cents`](src/main/kotlin/hm/binkley/kunits/Main.kt#L202)
- Subtraction:
  [`(m1 into Hands) - m1`](src/main/kotlin/hm/binkley/kunits/Main.kt#L113)
- Multiplication:
  [`m2 * 4`](src/main/kotlin/hm/binkley/kunits/Main.kt#L166)
- Division:
  [`m2 / 4`](src/main/kotlin/hm/binkley/kunits/Main.kt#L168)

#### Converting measures into other units

- Between units of the same kind within a system:
  [`m3 into Ounces`](src/main/kotlin/hm/binkley/kunits/Main.kt#L182), or as
  shorthand, [`m1 /
  Barleycorns`](src/main/kotlin/hm/binkley/kunits/Main.kt#L117)
- Into multiple other units of the same kind within a system:
  [`m4.into(DollarCoins, HalfDollars, Quarters, Dimes, Nickels,
  Pennies)`](src/main/kotlin/hm/binkley/kunits/Main.kt#L203), or as shorthand,
  [`m4 % looseChange`](src/main/kotlin/hm/binkley/kunits/Main.kt#L219)
- Between units of the same kind between different systems:
  [`1.smoots intoEnglish
  Inches`](src/main/kotlin/hm/binkley/kunits/Main.kt#L237)

#### Pretty printing

- Default formatting:
  [`"${220.yards} IN $English IS ${220.yards intoFFF Furlongs} IN
  $FFF"`](src/main/kotlin/hm/binkley/kunits/Main.kt#L236)
- Custom formatting:
  [`"- $it (${it.format()})"`](src/main/kotlin/hm/binkley/kunits/Main.kt#L223)

### API

- [`Kind`](src/main/kotlin/hm/binkley/kunits/Units.kt#L9) represents a
  kind of units (_eg_,
  [`Length`](src/main/kotlin/hm/binkley/kunits/Units.kt#L18))
- [`System`](src/main/kotlin/hm/binkley/kunits/Units.kt#L29) represents a
  system of units (_eg_,
  [`English`](src/main/kotlin/hm/binkley/kunits/system/english/English.kt))
- [`Units`](src/main/kotlin/hm/binkley/kunits/Units.kt#L46) represents
  units of measure (_eg_,
  [`MetasyntacticLengths`](src/test/kotlin/hm/binkley/kunits/TestSystems.kt#37))
- [`Measure`](src/main/kotlin/hm/binkley/kunits/Units.kt#L98) represents
  quantities of units (_eg_,
  [`m1`](src/main/kotlin/hm/binkley/kunits/Main.kt#L96))

Included for `Measure` are the usual simple arithmetic operations.

The exemplar of quirkiness is traditional
[_English units_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_units):

- [English units of denomination
  (money)](src/main/kotlin/hm/binkley/kunits/system/english/denomination/EnglishDenominations.kt)
- [English units of length](src/main/kotlin/hm/binkley/kunits/system/english/length/EnglishLengths.kt)
- [English units of time](src/main/kotlin/hm/binkley/kunits/system/english/time/EnglishTimes.kt)
- [English units of volume](src/main/kotlin/hm/binkley/kunits/system/english/volume/wine/EnglishWineVolumes.kt)
- [English units of weight](src/main/kotlin/hm/binkley/kunits/system/english/weight/EnglishWeights.kt)

Among the challenges with the English (British) systems of units is that
coinages available in historic periods do not always align with expression 
of value.
For example, the crown is a coin worth 5 shillings, however, it is notated 
as "5s" (5 shillings) rather as number of crowns as it was simply a coin, not a 
basis in the notation of value.
The same is true for many or most historic coinage systems though the 
English (British) system is most prominent.

An example of a historic English coin not represented is the [_gold
penny_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_penny) (20 pence in its time).

Unreal systems of units for testing:

- [`Metasyntactic`](src/test/kotlin/hm/binkley/kunits/TestSystems.kt#L54)
- [`Martian`](src/test/kotlin/hm/binkley/kunits/TestSystems.kt#L258)

Below is the source for the Martian system of units showing the minimal
code needed for setting up a system of units:

```kotlin
object Martian : System<Martian>("Martian")

infix fun <
    V : Units<Length, Metasyntactic, V, N>,
    N : Measure<Length, Metasyntactic, V, N>
    > Measure<Length, Martian, *, *>.intoMetasyntactic(
    other: V
) = into(other) {
    it * (1 over 3)
}

class Grok private constructor(value: FixedBigRational) :
    Measure<Length, Martian, Groks, Grok>(Groks, value) {
    companion object Groks : Units<Length, Martian, Groks, Grok>(
        Length,
        Martian,
        "grok",
        ONE
    ) {
        override fun new(quantity: FixedBigRational) = Grok(quantity)
        override fun format(quantity: FixedBigRational) = "$quantity groks"
    }
}

val FixedBigRational.groks get() = Groks.new(this)
val Long.groks get() = (this over 1).groks
val Int.groks get() = (this over 1).groks
```

For convenience, systems of units may provide [conversions into other
systems](src/test/kotlin/hm/binkley/kunits/TestSystems.kt#L56):

```kotlin
infix fun <
    V : Units<Length, Martian, V, N>,
    N : Measure<Length, Martian, V, N>
    > MetasyntacticLength<*, *>.intoMartian(
    other: V
) = into(other) {
    it * (3 over 1)
}
```

Typically, the base type for units of measure (`MartialLengths`, above) is
`sealed` as there is a known, fixed number of units.
However,
[`OtherDnDDenominations`](src/main/kotlin/hm/binkley/kunits/system/dnd/denomination/other/OtherDnDDenominations.kt)
is an example of extending a kind of units.

Also, see
[`ShoeSize`](src/test/kotlin/hm/binkley/kunits/TestSystems.kt#L224) for an
example of creating new kinds of units.

#### Use of generics

Generic signatures pervade types and function signatures.
The standard ordering is:

- `K` "kind" &mdash; is this length, weight, etc.
- `S` "system" &dash; is this English units, etc.
- `U` "unit" &dash; what unit is this?
- `M` "measure" &dash; how many units?

### Considerations

#### Syntactic sugar

> _Syntactic sugar causes cancer of the semicolon._<br/>
> &mdash; Alan J. Perlis

There are too many options for "nice" Kotlin syntactic sugar.
This library uses math/bit operators when sensible, and backs off where it
conflicts with the existing Kotlin standard library.

See [`Operators.kt`](./src/main/kotlin/hm/binkley/kunits/Operators.kt).
Simple math operators with `Measure` arithmetic (possily with conversion of
right-hand sides to the units of the left):
- `+a` &mdash; idempotency
- `-a` &mdash; negation
- `a + b` &mdash; addition
- `a - b` &mdash; subtraction
- `a * b` &mdash; multiplication
- `a / b` &mdash; division
- `a % b` &mdash; modulo -- an exact modulus including remainders using a
   largest-to-smallest ("greedy") approach

##### Handling "into" conversions


The most "natural English" approach might be:

```kotlin
2.feet in Inches // *not* valid Kotlin
```

However, this is a compilation failure as the "in" needs to be "\`in\`" since
`in` is a keyword in Kotlin.

Another might be:

```kotlin
2.feet to Inches
```

However, this overloads the standard library `to` function for creating `Pair`s
(very much needed when declaring maps).

Or consider:

```kotlin
2.feet as Inches
```

Unfortunately, `as` is an existing keyword for type casting.

The chosen compromise is an infix
[`into`](src/main/kotlin/hm/binkley/kunits/Conversions.kt#L45) function,
and a more general version for [conversions into unit units of the same
kind in another system](src/main/kotlin/hm/binkley/kunits/Conversions.kt#L70).

```kotlin
2.feet into Inches
```

Though infix functions do not chain nicely:

```kotlin
2.feet into Inches shouldBe 24.inches // what you expect
2.feet shouldBe 24.inches into Feet // does not compile
```

More readable might be:

```kotlin
(2.feet into Inches) shouldBe 24.inches // parentheses for readability
2.feet shouldBe (24.inches into Feet) // parentheses needed to compile
2.feet / Inches shouldBe 24.inches // operator binds more tightly than infix
2.feet shouldBe 24.inches / Feet // correct, but harder to read
```

And parentheses are required for correct binding order in some cases:

```kotlin
24.inches shouldBe (2.feet into Inches)
```

One may skip syntactic sugar altogether:

```kotlin
Feet(2).into(Inches)
```

At the cost of losing some pleasantness of Kotlin.

#### Inline

The trivial extension properties for converting `Int`, `Long`, and
`FixedBigRational` into units could be `inline` (as well as several others).
However, JaCoCo's [_Kotlin inline functions are not marked as
covered_](https://github.com/jacoco/jacoco/issues/654) lowers test coverage,
and Kover's [_Feature request: Equivalent Maven
plugin_](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-kover/issues/51) does not support
Maven.

Following [_The Rules_](https://wiki.c2.com/?MakeItWorkMakeItRightMakeItFast),
`inline` is removed for now, until JaCoCo resolves this issue.

#### Mixing compilation errors with runtime errors for the same problem

Incompatible unit conversions are inconsistent. The two cases are:

1. Converting between units of different kinds (say, lengths and weights) in
   the same system of units
2. Converting between units of the same kind (say, lengths) but in different
   systems of units

Behavior:

* Operations between incompatible units do not compile.
  This is **by design**.
  For example, you cannot convert feet into pounds.

```kotlin
// Does not compile: feet and pounds are different kinds of units
1.feet into Pounds
// Does not compile: both are lengths, but of different systems:
1.smoots into Inches
// This would both compile and run successfully:
1.smoots intoEnglish Inches
```
